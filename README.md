# Tweet Newsletter

Make yourself a newsletter curating tweets from your favorite Twitter accounts.

## How to use

1. Go to [Tweet Newsletter](https://tweet-newsletter-sandy.vercel.app/)
2. Enter your email address.
3. For Twitter ID, open the profile banner image of the Twitter account you follow in new tab. The ID is the number after `https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/<ID>` in the URL.
4. For multiple accounts, separate the IDs with commas.
5. Click "Subscribe".

Then:

- wait for few seconds to see the "Subscription successful!" message
- check your confirmation email in spam folder
- move the email to your inbox to receive future newsletters

If you have any issues, please create an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tmtri3102/tweet-newsletter/issues).

<strong>The newsletter is sent out at 16:23 GMT+7 daily</strong>
